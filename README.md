The program is an analogue of the system of organizing and
conducting tender purchases. I wrote a singleton class. This singleton class
was consisted of functions such as connection to WebSocket server,
sending and receiving data. So that I could use the instance of singleton
class in different view controllers to send request and receive response on
different stages of the process. The reason of this project was to learn how
to connect to WebSocket server, send request as JSON to server and
asynchronously receive response(using completion), parse it in
comfortable look and do different actions depending on the response.
